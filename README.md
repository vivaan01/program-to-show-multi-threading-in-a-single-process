In C++, context switching can be demonstrated using the standard library’s std::thread class, which allows creating and running threads concurrently. The code example below uses threads to run multiple tasks, simulating context switching by having threads yield control periodically.

Key Concepts:

	•	Concurrency: Running multiple tasks in overlapping time periods, achieved through threads.
	•	Threads: Independent paths of execution within a program. Each thread has its own execution context, allowing simultaneous operations.
	•	Multithreading: Using multiple threads to execute concurrent tasks within a single program. Threads can share memory, so synchronizing access is critical to avoid data races.
